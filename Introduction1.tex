After 25 years the University of Oslo  Library finally decided to do something about subject search in their OPAC. In a 2010 report it was documented  used several classicition schemes and several controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies spread over a number of MARC-fields. Naturally, the report concluded thatt the  road ahead  was to reduce the number of systems and make crosswalks between the remaing systems.

As a proactive action the Sciencelibrary had already started their work of establishing a  controlled vocabulary based on the uncontrolled keywords from nine different  department libraries (physics, chemistry, biology, etc)
